# Guidelines
## Writing

When writing for IPFS, be it commit messages or posting issues, here's a collection of things to take note of.

### Ungendering

#### Motivation

Avoiding gendering in community interaction has multiple benefits. Using a male or female pronoun alienates and unfairly prioritizes one gender in favor of another. For instance, saying "the user and his computer" may feel alienating to women, or vice versa. Luckily, in English, the pronoun 'their' can be used as both a singular and a plural form (cf. [Singular they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)). Saying, "the user and their computer" is entirely acceptable and alleviates the issue. Furthermore, this also includes extraterrestial beings and future life forms.

#### Proposal

Avoid gendering in writing, do not assume that the user/reader is of a certain gender. 

Do's:
```
users install IPFS on their computers
users can choose what to broadcast in the DHT
```

Don'ts:
```
the user installs IPFS on his computer
user A can choose if the hash of her newly added file is broadcasted
```

Established canon like Alice and Bob can still be used in the gendered way.
